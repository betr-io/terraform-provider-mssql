  ]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `server` - (Required) Server and login details for the SQL Server. The attributes supported in the `server` block is detailed below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `database` - (Required) The name of the database to operate on. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `principal_id` - (Required) The principal ID of the user permissions are managed for. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `permissions` - (Required) List of permissions to grant to the user. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

The `server` block supports the following arguments:

* `host` - (Required) The host of the SQL Server. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `port` - (Optional) The port of the SQL Server. Defaults to `1433`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `login` - (Optional) SQL Server login for managing the database resources. The attributes supported in the `login` block is detailed below.
* `azure_login` - (Optional) Azure AD login for managing the database resources. The attributes supported in the `azure_login` block is detailed below.
* `azuread_default_chain_auth` - (Optional) Use a chain of strategies for authenticating when managing the database resources. This auth strategy is very similar to how the Azure CLI authenticates. For more information, see [DefaultAzureCredential](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/wiki/Set-up-Your-Environment-for-Authentication#configure-defaultazurecredential). This block has no attributes.
* `azuread_managed_identity_auth` - (Optional) Use a managed identity for authenticating when managing the database resources. This is mainly useful for specifying a user-assigned managed identity. The attributes supported in the `azuread_managed_identity_auth` block is detailed below.

The `login` block supports the following arguments:

* `username` - (Required) The username of the SQL Server login. Can also be sourced from the `MSSQL_USERNAME` environment variable.
* `password` - (Required) The password of the SQL Server login. Can also be sourced from the `MSSQL_PASSWORD` environment variable.

The `azure_login` block supports the following arguments:

* `tenant_id` - (Required) The tenant ID of the principal used to login to the SQL Server. Can also be sourced from the `MSSQL_TENANT_ID` environment variable.
* `client_id` - (Required) The client ID of the principal used to login to the SQL Server. Can also be sourced from the `MSSQL_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.
* `client_secret` - (Required) The client secret of the principal used to login to the SQL Server. Can also be sourced from the `MSSQL_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable.

The `azuread_managed_identity_auth` block supports the following arguments:

* `user_id` - (Optional) Id of a user-assigned managed identity to assume. Omitting this property instructs the provider to assume a system-assigned managed identity.

-> Only one of `login`, `azure_login`, `azuread_default_chain_auth` and `azuread_managed_identity_auth` can be specified.
